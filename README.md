# Digital-Portfolio

Welcome to my digital portfolio, created as part of the PRP370-1-2S Project Presentation 3 assessment at Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT).
This portfolio showcases the evidence and personal reflections from my participation in the Work Readiness Training Programme. environment. The goal is to present a polished, accessible summary of my development, suitable for academic evaluation and potential employers.

# 1. Career Counselling – Reflection (STAR)

# Situation:
During my second year at CPUT, I attended a career counselling session provided by the Work Readiness Programme. The purpose was to help ICT students identify their ideal career paths and understand how their studies align with professional goals.

# Task:
My goal was to use this session to discover a fitting ICT career based on my interests, strengths, and long-term aspirations. I needed to evaluate career options and plan necessary steps for success.

# Action:
I completed a self-assessment survey during the session, discussed the outcomes with a facilitator, and explored roles such as Systems Analyst, Software Developer, and Network Technician. I asked questions about career development, certifications, and internship strategies.

# Result:
I gained valuable clarity on my strengths and confirmed my interest in becoming a back-end developer. I created a short- and long-term career development plan, including certifications and project experience, and have been more focused in my academic and personal growth ever since.
