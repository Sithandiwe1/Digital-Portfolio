# Digital-Portfolio

Welcome to my digital portfolio, created as part of the PRP370-1-2S Project Presentation 3 assessment at Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT).
This portfolio showcases the evidence and personal reflections from my participation in the Work Readiness Training Programme. environment. The goal is to present a polished, accessible summary of my development, suitable for academic evaluation and potential employers.

# 1. Career Counselling

# Evidence
I attended a structured career counselling session as part of the Work Readiness Programme.  
During this session, I completed a personal career assessment that helped me understand different roles in the ICT industry.  
We were provided with guidance on how to set long-term goals, choose suitable career paths, and identify required skills.  
The feedback and tools from this session played a key role in shaping my short- and long-term professional goals.

# Reflection 

# Situation:
During my second year at CPUT, I attended a career counselling session provided by the Work Readiness Programme. The purpose was to help ICT students identify their ideal career paths and understand how their studies align with professional goals.

# Task:
My goal was to use this session to discover a fitting ICT career based on my interests, strengths, and long-term aspirations. I needed to evaluate career options and plan necessary steps for success.

# Action:
I completed a self-assessment survey during the session, discussed the outcomes with a facilitator, and explored roles such as Systems Analyst, Software Developer, and Network Technician. I asked questions about career development, certifications, and internship strategies.

# Result:
I gained valuable clarity on my strengths and confirmed my interest in becoming a back-end developer. I created a short- and long-term career development plan, including certifications and project experience, and have been more focused in my academic and personal growth ever since.

# 2. Skills and Interests  
# Evidence
As part of our curriculum, I participated in a group web development project where I applied my programming skills.  
I used HTML, CSS, SQL, and Figma to build a fully functioning event management website with database integration.  
This project helped me identify my passion for back-end development and database management systems.  
It also showed me the importance of soft skills such as teamwork, time management, and effective communication.

# Reflection 
# Situation:
Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked on a variety of practical assignments that helped me identify my core interests and skills. One notable experience was my group event management project in Project 2.

# Task:
My role was to design and develop the website’s front-end and connect it to the back-end database. I also needed to apply theoretical knowledge from database and web development classes.

# Action:
Using HTML, CSS, and SQL, I built functional user interfaces and integrated them with a MySQL database. I collaborated on design using Figma and used GitHub to manage project versions. I focused heavily on problem-solving and back-end logic, which I enjoyed.

# Result:
The project was a success and reinforced my interest in web and software development, especially the back-end processes. This led me to spend more time improving my skills in Python, Java, and databases, and I now actively seek opportunities to apply them in real projects.

# 3. Personality Assessment
# Evidence:
I completed the 16Personalities assessment, a recognized tool used to explore personality types and working styles.  
My result identified me as an ISTJ, someone who is structured, reliable, and logical—traits aligned with development roles.  
This personality profile helped me understand how I prefer to work in teams and solve problems systematically.  
The insights I gained were valuable in guiding my professional conduct and approach to teamwork and leadership.

# Reflection 
# Situation:
As part of our Work Readiness Training, we were encouraged to take a personality assessment to better understand our working style and career compatibility. I used the 16Personalities tool for this purpose.

# Task:
The objective was to identify my personality traits and reflect on how they influence my learning, teamwork, and career preferences. I needed to connect these traits to real examples of my behavior and choices.

# Action:
After completing the assessment, I was classified as an ISTJ – logical, dependable, and detail-oriented. I analyzed how this profile aligns with my preference for structure, routine, and analytical tasks. I reviewed my project experiences through this lens.

# Result:
The results validated my enjoyment of structured programming tasks and database management. It helped me understand my preference for clarity and order, and I now actively seek roles where I can use these strengths in development and systems analysis.

# 4. Create a CV 
# Evidence:
I created a professional CV using guidelines discussed in class and examples shared by my lecturer.  
The CV includes my personal information, academic background, technical skills, work experience, and references.  
I highlighted key technologies such as Python, Java, SQL, and design tools like Figma to reflect my strengths.  
I used clear formatting to ensure the CV is both visually appealing and easy for employers to navigate.

# Reflection 
# Situation:
One of the tasks in the assessment was to create a professional CV that would be included in our digital portfolio. This CV would reflect both academic accomplishments and relevant work experience.

# Task:
I needed to present a clear and concise summary of my qualifications, technical skills, and experience in a professional format suitable for job applications and internships.

# Action:
I used templates and best practices from class, incorporated feedback from my lecturer, and included key experiences such as my volunteer technician role and academic projects. I ensured the layout was clean and highlighted essential technical skills like Python, SQL, and Figma.

# Result:
The final CV is a strong representation of who I am as an emerging ICT professional. It’s tailored for developer and technician roles and presents my skills, education, and experience in a well-organized way. I now feel more prepared and confident to apply for industry roles.

# 5. CV Submission
# Evidence:
I submitted my CV digitally by creating a GitHub repository for this assessment, showcasing my digital competency.  
All files, including this README and my CV, were uploaded and organized using Markdown for presentation.  
The repository serves as both a professional portfolio and evidence of my ability to use version control tools.  
This method of submission reflects industry practice, where developers often share work via Git platforms.

# Reflection 
# Situation:
To showcase our professionalism and digital literacy, we were required to submit our CV as part of a GitHub-based digital portfolio. This also tested our ability to present work using online tools.

# Task:
The task was to upload and organize all relevant files, including the CV, in a GitHub repository using Markdown for documentation. The portfolio needed to be presentable, accessible, and well-structured.

# Action:
I created a new GitHub repository titled digital-portfolio, wrote a professional README.md file in Markdown, and uploaded my CV in PDF format. I used proper linking and formatting to ensure that everything was easy to navigate and understand.

# Result:
My GitHub repository now functions as a complete e-portfolio that I can share with future employers. This exercise taught me how to manage a digital presence professionally and use GitHub as more than just a code repository—it’s now also my online career showcase.
