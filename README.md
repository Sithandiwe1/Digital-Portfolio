# 1. Career Counselling â€“ Reflection (STAR)

# Situation:
During my second year at CPUT, I attended a career counselling session provided by the Work Readiness Programme. The purpose was to help ICT students identify their ideal career paths and understand how their studies align with professional goals.

# Task:
My goal was to use this session to discover a fitting ICT career based on my interests, strengths, and long-term aspirations. I needed to evaluate career options and plan necessary steps for success.

# Action:
I completed a self-assessment survey during the session, discussed the outcomes with a facilitator, and explored roles such as Systems Analyst, Software Developer, and Network Technician. I asked questions about career development, certifications, and internship strategies.

# Result:
I gained valuable clarity on my strengths and confirmed my interest in becoming a back-end developer. I created a short- and long-term career development plan, including certifications and project experience, and have been more focused in my academic and personal growth ever since.
